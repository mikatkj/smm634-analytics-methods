Problem set description:

Consider the R function `clusterboot()` form package `fpc`. The reference of this package is *Hennig, C. (2007) Cluster-wise assessment of cluster stability. Computational Statistics and Data Analysis, 52, 258-271.* Write a brief report (no more than 1000 words) on this function where you explain its purpose and algorithm’s steps; illustrate its use on a ﬁctitious dataset generated by you and comment on the results. Note that you should not replicate the example in the helpﬁle nor using any example available online.

Methodology:

- Assess cluster-wise stability by resampling (using the Jaccard coefficient)
- Resampling methods: bootstrap, subsamples, random noise from uniform distribution, jittering
- Integrated clustering functions: k-means, hierarchical clustering with average linkage, model-based clustering (Gaussian mixture)
